# Themis Overview

## Product Name

Themis

## Core Problem

Most project and task management tools create too much cognitive load for day-to-day engineering work.

Typical friction points:

- tasks are vague or under-defined
- requirements get buried in chat, docs, or code comments
- scope changes are not tracked clearly
- status updates become manual overhead instead of useful signal
- documentation and execution drift apart quickly
- tools feel heavier than the work itself

## Product Intent

Build Themis as a simpler, developer-friendly task system that behaves more like a structured operational database than a traditional project management suite.

The system should make it easy to:

- define tasks clearly
- keep scope visible
- attach context and decisions directly to the task
- update progress continuously with low friction
- expose structured data that humans and AI/code agents can both consume

## Product Philosophy

This system should optimize for clarity, continuity, and low mental overhead.

Principles:

- task definition before task execution
- structured context over free-form chaos
- documentation as part of the task, not a separate afterthought
- progress as a living state machine, not a static checklist
- developer-native workflow over generic business tooling
- AI-readable by design, not AI-bolted-on later

## Desired Experience

The user should feel that:

- every task starts with enough context to act
- nothing important is lost between idea, scope, and execution
- updates take seconds, not minutes
- the system helps thinking instead of demanding attention
- tasks become reliable operational objects, not disposable notes

## Product Shape

This can evolve as:

1. a standalone module inside this repo
2. a standalone product surface behind the same monolith runtime
3. eventually a more general internal operating system for product and engineering work

## High-Level Scope

First version should focus on:

- tasks
- scope
- requirements
- status tracking
- execution notes
- agent-readable context

It should avoid, at first:

- complex Gantt planning
- multi-layer enterprise permission systems
- heavy reporting dashboards
- advanced portfolio management
- too many entity types too early

## Expected Outcome

The system becomes a practical daily workspace for individual contributors and leads who need:

- reliable task definition
- visibility into progress
- consistent documentation
- smoother collaboration with AI/code agents
