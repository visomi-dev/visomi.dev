      I am a self-taught developer who embarked on this journey in 2011 at the
      age of 16. I started exploring programming and programming languages and
      quickly fell in love with them. I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
      Python. I began writing scripts to make my work more enjoyable (I was
      working as a Technical Support professional at the age of 19) and to
      automate repetitive tasks.

      When I turned 21, I started working as a web developer and began learning
      about React and Node.js. This was the moment when I started delving into
      software architectures and discovering how to create scalable
      applications, marking the beginning of my adventure in this fascinating
      world.
